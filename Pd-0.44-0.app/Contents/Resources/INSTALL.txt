Quick compilation instructions for Linux or Mac OSX, or Windows if you have
installed gygwin:  make sure "automake" is installed as well as the
usual C compiler chain.  Then in this directory, type "./autogen.sh", then
"./configure"; then "make".

Alternatively, you can use the fallback makefiles in "src" for gnu/linux, Mac
OSX, or Microsoft Visual C.  (Special instructions for Microsoft Visual C: cd
to src and type "make -f makefile.nt".  Then CD to the various subdirs of extra
and type "make nt" in each.)
